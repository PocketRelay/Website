# Server Ports

[Back](/guide/config)

The server ports section of the configuration file contains the ports that each of the servers will listen on

```json
{
  "ports": {
    "redirector": 42127,
    "main": 42128,
    "telemetry": 42129,
    "qos": 42130,
    "http": 80
  }
}
```

> If you are going to/have port forwarded and change any of these ports you will also need to change your port forwarded ports and if you're in Docker you'll need to change the exposed ports

Ports can be any number between 1 and 65536 however ports below 1024 on linux require that the server be launched with sudo
