# Telemetry

The official server has telemetry servers that receive client telemetry messages from the Mass Effect 3 game there are messages for all sorts of things like Killing Enemies, Viewing specific menus, Unlocking challenges, Changing Characters, Client loaded DLC, etc. 

For **Pocket Relay** this special message format is handled locally and then forwarded-on to the server over an HTTP endpoint
