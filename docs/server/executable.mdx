# Executable

Creating a server using the server executable

## 1) Download server

First, you must download the server executable for your desired platform below:

:::info
If you would prefer to compile your own binary rather than using the pre-built binaries below
you can follow the [Manual Building](manual-building.md) guide
:::

import WindowsIcon from "../../src/components/icons/WindowsIcon";
import LinuxIcon from "../../src/components/icons/LinuxIcon";

| Variant                | Link                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <WindowsIcon/> Windows | [Download](https://github.com/PocketRelay/Server/releases/latest/download/pocket-relay-windows.exe) |
| <LinuxIcon/> Linux     | [Download](https://github.com/PocketRelay/Server/releases/latest/download/pocket-relay-linux)       |

## 2) Creating a server folder

As the server is going to create itself a data folder you are going to want to place the server executable in its own folder with no other files.

The server will generate its own "data" folder in this folder

## 3) Starting the server

<Tabs groupId="platform">
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
    <p>
      When using Windows you can either open the executable as your normally
      would any other .exe file or you can launch it through a terminal using
      the following command:
    </p>
    <CodeBlock language="sh">./pocket-relay.exe</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    <p>
      When using linux you must first make the program executable. You can do
      this using the following command:
    </p>
    <CodeBlock language="sh">chmod +x ./pocket-relay</CodeBlock>
    <p>You can then start the server with the following command</p>
    <CodeBlock language="sh">./pocket-relay</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
By default the server uses port 80, this port may already be in use on your system if it is
you will either need to stop the other application using port 80 or change this port

If you are using Linux port 80 will require using "sudo" to start the application

To change this port see [Configuration](configuration.md)
:::

## 4) Connection URL

Now that your server is up and running it will output possible **Connection URLs** that you can use, these Connection URLs will also appear
in the server log file (server.log). You will need to provide one of these Connection URLs to anyone who you would like to join the server.

You can find the server log file at the following path (Relative to the folder that the server executable is stored in)

```
data/server.log
```

:::caution
Server log files can contain personal access tokens, so it is recommened you do **NOT** post them publicly anywhere, only sharing them with
the **Pocket Relay** developer if you need to debug an issue
:::

Within the server log file you should see a line similar to the following:

```log
[2022-11-28T15:14:35.555306400+13:00 INFO pocket_relay] Connection URLS (LAN: 192.168.88.251, WAN: IP_REDACTED, LOCAL: 127.0.0.1)
```

In order to determine which Connection URL you should give to someone see the table below:

| Type  | Who you should give it to                                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LAN   | Someone who is on the same wifi network as you                          |
| WAN   | Someone on a different wifi network i.e over the internet               |
| LOCAL | Can be used if the server is running on the same computer as the client |

:::info
If you are looking to use your **WAN** address you will need to portforward the server port (TCP) in your
router or the host that you are using, the default port is 80.

## Done

This is the end of the executable server setup guide. From here you can check out the [Configuration](configuration.md) guide to further configure your server
