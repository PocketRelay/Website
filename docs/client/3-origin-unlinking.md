# Unlinking from Origin

Guide for un-linking your game from Origin to allow creating accounts in-game


If you are using an Origin version of the game (Origin, EA Desktop, or Steam) these versions all lock you into authenticating through **Origin**

In order to enable the login screen in-game so that you can login using a email and password (Creating new accounts in-game as well) you can follow
the steps below

:::info
If you are using ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager see [ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager](#me3-tweaks-mod-manager)
:::

:::note
Un-linking from Origin does **NOT** remove the requirement for having Origin installed, this only applies to within the game, Origin/EA Desktop will still be required for the game to launch
:::

Once you've unlinked from Origin check out the [Unlinked Accounts](./9-unlinked-accounts.md) guide for creating and logging into unlinked accounts
