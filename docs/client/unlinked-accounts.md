# Unlinked Accounts

Creating an unlinked account in-game

When using an Unlinked copy whether it be because you've followed [Origin Unlinking](./origin-unlinking.md) or because you're using an "Unofficial" copy of the game this guide shows creating and logging into accounts in-game 


## Initial Error

When opening the game with an unlinked copy you'll likely see the following error message:

![ME3 Error](./img/me-error.png)

This is caused by the game attempting to login to the server using credentials that are meant for the official server. These credentials wont work which causes an error.
You can simply press **"OK"** to close this error message after which you will be taken to the Main Menu

:::note
This error message may appear several times, you will simply have to press "OK" to the message as this is not something
that can be fixed on the server
:::

## Login screen

Once you're on the main menu screen you can push one of the following buttons to open the login prompt

![Multiplayer Button](./img/me-multiplayer.png)
![Alternative Multiplayer Button](./img/me-multiplayer-alt.png)

after pushing one of the buttons the following login screen should appear, if you've already created an account you can use this screen to login using the email and password of the account you created:

If you don't already have an account on the server you can press the **"Create an Origin Account (EA)"** button

## Create Screen

After clicking the **"Create an Origin Account (EA)"** button you should see the following screen, here you can enter the credentials for
your new account and then press **"Accept"** to create your account

Mass Effect 3, you must accept the terms using **"I Have Read and Accept Both Documents"** in order to create an account
