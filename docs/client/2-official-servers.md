# Official Servers

Information about playing on the official ME3 servers

:::note
You do **NOT** need to remove the patches or delete any files to play on the official servers

However, if you have followed [Origin Unlinking](./3-origin-unlinking.md) you will likely want to follow the removal/uninstall guides on that page, otherwise when you switch back to the official servers you will have to login in-game using your actual Origin/EA email & password rather than being logged in automatically.
:::

If you would like to return to the official servers simply close the **Pocket Relay Client** app and restart your **Mass Effect 3** if it is already running. You should return back to the official servers
