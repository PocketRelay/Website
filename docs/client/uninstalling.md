# Uninstalling

Guide for completely removing Pocket Relay Client

## Removing Patch

:::info
If you have applied your patch through ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager you may want to skip this
step as it may affect your existing mods and plugins
:::

Open the Pocket Relay client and select the **"Remove Patch"** button then select your MassEffect3.exe like
in the installation guide and the patch will be removed

## Deleting client

The client installation is portable so this final step is just deleting the .exe file you downloaded for the client

## Deleting saved connection URL

If you have previously saved a connection URL the client will create a pocket-relay-config.json file in the same folder
as the executable. You can delete this file to remove it.
