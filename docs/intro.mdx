# Welcome to Pocket Relay

Explore guides related to both server and client topics in the **Pocket Relay** guide.

## What is Pocket Relay

**Pocket Relay** is a server designed to replicate official game server functionality, allowing you to enjoy 
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer independently of the official server. With **Pocket Relay**, you can create LAN games, 
play multiplayer offline, or even host your own public server.

When you set up your **Pocket Relay** server, you gain complete control over player inventories. This means you can 
experiment with equipment and characters you don't have on the official servers by unlocking and playing with them using **Pocket Relay**.


## How it works

This project consists of two main components: the _Client_ – a program to connect to **Pocket Relay** servers, and 
the _Server_ – where all clients connect to play together.

For clients to join each other, they must be connected to the same _Server_.

## Getting started

If you want to join a public server or have already created your own server using the server guide, follow the [Joining a Server](./client/1-joining.mdx) guide.

To create a server, check out the [Creating a Server](./server/1-creating.md) guide, which also provides information on server configuration.
