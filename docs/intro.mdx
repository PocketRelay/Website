# Introduction

Welcome the **Pocket Relay** guide, here you can find guides for server and client related topics

## What is Pocket Relay

**Pocket Relay** is a server that has been created in order to emulate the functionality of the official game servers to
allow you to play the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer seperate from the official server. This allows you create LAN games,
play multiplayer offline, or even host your own public server.

When creating your own **Pocket Relay** server, you have full control over the player inventories, this means if you would
like to experiment with equipment or characters that you don't have on the official servers, you can use **Pocket Relay**
to unlock and play with those characters.

## How it works

This project is split up into two parts you have the _Client_ which is a program that you use to connect to **Pocket Relay** servers
and a _Server_ which all the _Client's_ connect to in order to play together.

If clients want to join eachother they must be connected to the same **Server**.

## Getting started

If you would like to join a public server, or you have already created your own server using the server guide you can follow
the [Joining a server](./client/joining) guide.

If you would like to create a server you can follow the [Creating a server](./server/creating) guide. This guide also contains
information for configuring your server
