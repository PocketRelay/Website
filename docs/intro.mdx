:::note Which should I pick

If you are looking to play by yourself and don't want to use someone elses server you should follow the ["I want to create a server" Executable](./server/2-executable.mdx) guide to locally run your own server on the same computer.

If you are just planning on joining someone else on their server / an existing server you do **NOT** need to setup a server.

## What is Pocket Relay

**Pocket Relay** is a server designed to replicate official game server functionality, allowing you to enjoy 
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer independently of the official server. With **Pocket Relay**, you can create LAN games, 
play multiplayer offline, or even host your own public server.

When you set up your **Pocket Relay** server, you gain complete control over player inventories. This means you can 
experiment with equipment and characters you don't have on the official servers by unlocking and playing with them using **Pocket Relay**.

I [Jacobtread](https://jacobtread.com) created Pocket Relay as a side project exploring how I could play Mass Effect 3 by myself, it has since
grown into an alternative to the official servers.
